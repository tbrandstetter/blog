            "content_html": "\n    <h2 id=\"a-few-words-about-terraform\">\n      A few words about Terraform\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    If you have read my <a href=\"https://norocketscience.at/about/\">last blog post</a> you already know how to create templates for further provisioning using the Cloud-init specification. In this post I like to show you how you easily deploy your infrastructure using Terraform on the virtualisation solution Proxmox. First of all, what is Terraform exactly? Terraform is a so called \"Infrastructure as a code\" software developed by <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com\">Hashicorp</a> - a company which also created <a href=\"https://www.vagrantup.com\">Vagrant</a> and other famous tools for professional cloud solutions. According to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">Microsoft</a>,<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.<br>\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    What's the benefit you may ask. One of the biggest advantages is that you don't have to install your servers and other components manually. Instead, with just a few lines of code you're able to manage your complete infrastructure. This automation step brings your stability, quality improvements, resilience and time for more important things. Furthermore, you have the possibility to integrate your Terraform configuration into your existing VCS and automatically run changes through your infrastructure with a proper CI/CD pipeline.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Another good question - why use Terraform if you've already have Ansible in place?Have you ever tried to remove a package in Ansible? If you just remove it from you playbook configuration it is still on your server until you write the right configuration (the attribute \"absent\" is your friend) or remove it manualy. Terraform takes care on this changes and has a clever dependency management for \"First this, then that\" decisions. Writing about the differences between the two would hijack my \"Terraform practicing\" article, so to keep a long story short:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Use Terraform for all your infrastructure stuff (VMs and the baseline software on it)</li><li>Use Ansible for the configuration management (Installation of Applications and the configuration of it)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <h2 id=\"lets-start-practicing\">\n      Let's start practicing\n    </h2>\n\n    <h3 id=\"assumptions\">\n      Assumptions\n    </h3>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>You have already a Proxmox server installed (it works with other virtualisation and cloud providers too - but this article is about Proxmox and Terraform)</li><li>You have already OS-templates with Cloud-init defined (if not, please read my <a href=\"https://norocketscience.at/about/\">blog post</a> about it)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <h3 id=\"installation-of-terraform\">\n      Installation of Terraform\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    You can install Terraform on the major plattforms using either the package manager/appstore from the chosen system or download the binaries from <br><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install\">Hashicorp</a> directly. On OSX I used <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for OSX.\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>bash\nbrew install terraform</code></pre>\n\n    <h3 id=\"configure-your-first-terraform-project\">\n      Configure your first Terraform project\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Now we're going to configure our first Terraform infrastructure which runs on Proxmox. In my example, I like to install a small Kubernetes infrastructure which should run <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\">K3s (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution)</a> later on. For that <br>we have to define the following environment:<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>1 x Master Server</li><li>2 x Node Server</li><li>1 x Storage Server (for persistent storage)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n    <h4 id=\"configure-the-proxmox-provider\">\n      Configure the Proxmox provider\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    First, we configure the connection settings for the Proxmox provider. I chose the provider from <a href=\"https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox\">Telmate</a> for the Proxmox provisioning. For better readability of our infrastructure code, we split variables and provider in two different configuration files named <em></em><strong><em>variables.tf</em> </strong>and <strong><em>provider.tf</em></strong>\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-json\"><code># variables.tf\n\nvariable \"pm_api_url\" {\n  default = \"https://your-ip:8006/api2/json\"\n}\n\nvariable \"pm_user\" {\n  default = \"terraform-prov@pve\"\n}\n\nvariable \"pm_password\" {\n  default = \"your-password\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-json\"><code># provider.tf\n\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    proxmox = {\n      source  = \"telmate/proxmox\"\n      version = \"3.0.2-rc07\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nprovider \"proxmox\" {\n  pm_parallel     = 1\n  pm_tls_insecure = true\n  pm_api_url      = var.pm_api_url\n  pm_password     = var.pm_password\n  pm_user         = var.pm_user\n  pm_log_enable   = true\n  pm_log_file     = \"terraform-plugin-proxmox.log\"\n  pm_debug        = true\n  pm_log_levels = {\n    _default    = \"debug\"\n    _capturelog = \"\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h4 id=\"configure-the-virtual-machines\">\n      Configure the virtual machines\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Next step is the main configuration of our k3s-cluster server. Here you have to adapt the following attributes according to your configuration:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>target_node (the name of your Proxmox instance)</li><li>name (the name of the virtual server)</li><li>clone (the name of the template in Proxmox)</li><li>cores</li><li>memory</li><li>storage (the right storage pool in Proxmox)</li><li>ipconfig0 (Use the right IP range for your servers - the count.index is necessary if you have more then one server configured - like the k3s_agents in the example below)</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    The \"ignore changes\" lifecycle block is necessary, because Terraform likes to change the mac address on the second run - maybe a problem in the Proxmox provider - see here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112\">https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112</a>\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-json\"><code># main.cf\n\nresource \"proxmox_vm_qemu\" \"k3s_server\" {\n  count             = 1\n  name              = \"kubernetes-master-${count.index}\"\n  target_node       = \"homelab\"\n\n  clone             = \"ubuntu-2404-cloudinit-template\"\n\n  os_type           = \"cloud-init\"\n  cpu {\n    cores             = 4\n    sockets           = \"1\"\n    type               = \"host\"\n  }\n  memory            = 1024\n  scsihw            = \"virtio-scsi-pci\"\n  boot              = \"order=scsi0\"\n\n  disks {\n    scsi {\n      scsi0 {\n        disk {\n          size     = \"20G\"\n          storage  = \"data\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  network {\n    id              = 0\n    model           = \"virtio\"\n    bridge          = \"vmbr0\"\n  }\n\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes  = [\n      network,\n    ]\n  }\n\n  # Cloud Init Settings\n  ipconfig0         = \"ip=192.168.2.11${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1\"\n\n  sshkeys = &lt;&lt;EOF\n  ${var.ssh_key}\n  EOF\n}\n\nresource \"proxmox_vm_qemu\" \"k3s_agent\" {\n  count             = 2\n  name              = \"kubernetes-node-${count.index}\"\n  target_node       = \"homelab\"\n\n  clone             = \"ubuntu-2404-cloudinit-template\"\n\n  os_type           = \"cloud-init\"\n  cpu {\n    cores             = 4\n    sockets           = \"1\"\n    type               = \"host\"\n  }\n  memory            = 1024\n  scsihw            = \"virtio-scsi-pci\"\n  boot              = \"order=scsi0\"\n\n  disks {\n    scsi {\n      scsi0 {\n        disk {\n          size     = \"20G\"\n          storage  = \"data\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  network {\n    id              = 0\n    model           = \"virtio\"\n    bridge          = \"vmbr0\"\n  }\n\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes  = [\n      network,\n    ]\n  }\n\n  # Cloud Init Settings\n  ipconfig0         = \"ip=192.168.2.12${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1\"\n\n  sshkeys = &lt;&lt;EOF\n  ${var.ssh_key}\n  EOF\n}\n\nresource \"proxmox_vm_qemu\" \"storage\" {\n  count             = 1\n  name              = \"storage-node-${count.index}\"\n  target_node       = \"homelab\"\n\n  clone             = \"ubuntu-2404-cloudinit-template\"\n\n  os_type           = \"cloud-init\"\n  cpu {\n    cores             = 4\n    sockets           = \"1\"\n    type               = \"host\"\n  }\n  memory            = 1024\n  scsihw            = \"virtio-scsi-pci\"\n  boot              = \"order=scsi0\"\n\n  disks {\n    scsi {\n      scsi0 {\n        disk {\n          size     = \"20G\"\n          storage  = \"data\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  network {\n    id              = 0\n    model           = \"virtio\"\n    bridge          = \"vmbr0\"\n  }\n\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes  = [\n      network,\n    ]\n  }\n\n  # Cloud Init Settings\n  ipconfig0         = \"ip=192.168.2.13${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1\"\n\n  sshkeys = &lt;&lt;EOF\n  ${var.ssh_key}\n  EOF\n}</code></pre>\n\n    <h4 id=\"add-ssh-pubkey-for-cloud-init\">\n      Add ssh-pubkey for Cloud-init\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    To get passwordless login (useful for tools like Ansible), create a variable with your ssh_key in the <strong><em>variables.tf</em></strong> file:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-json\"><code># variables.tf\n\nvariable \"ssh_key\" {\n  default = \"ssh-rsa ...\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h3 id=\"deployment-time\">\n      Deployment time\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Terraform has a simple but powerful deployment cycle, which consists of the following steps:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Init -

Applies the changes on the configured systems</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    If you try to skip a step for example start with terraform plan, Terraform inform you to initialise the project first:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>Error: Could not satisfy plugin requirements\n\n\nPlugin reinitialization required. Please run \"terraform init\".\n\nPlugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate\nresources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,\ndon't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.\n\nTerraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your\nconfiguration, including providers used in child modules. To see the\nrequirements and constraints from each module, run \"terraform providers\".\n\n\n\nError: provider.proxmox: new or changed plugin executable</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    So let's start with the initialisation first:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>terraform init\n\nInitializing the backend...\n\nInitializing provider plugins...\n\nTerraform has been successfully initialized!\n\nYou may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see\nany changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands\nshould now work.\n\nIf you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,\nrerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other\ncommands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    And Terraform informs you about the next step. But instead we like to check if our configuration ist correct:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>terraform validate\n\nSuccess! The configuration is valid.</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Seems we did a good job during our configuration. Now it's the time to see what Terraform likes to deploy:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>terraform plan\n\nRefreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...\nThe refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be\npersisted to local or remote state storage.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn execution plan has been generated and is shown below.\nResource actions are indicated with the following symbols:\n  + create\n\nTerraform will perform the following actions:\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nPlan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis plan was saved to: planfile\n\nTo perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:\n    terraform apply \"planfile\"\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    As you can see - Terraform likes to install 4 new server. It also shows us the detailed configuration. The configuration can be read like a \"diff\" file:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\"+\" means add</li><li>\"-\" means remove</li><li>\"~\" means replaced</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    The file \"planfile\" can be used for the next apply command:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>terraform apply planfile\n\nApply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.\n\nThe state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path\nbelow. This state is required to modify and destroy your\ninfrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state\nuse the `terraform show` command.\n\nState path: terraform.tfstate</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    Depending on your hardware this needs some time. If everything runs fine you can see the output above. Terraform successfully created 4 new ressources, which you can use for install the K3s cluster. Because we don't like to install anything manually we will use Ansible for this job. <br><br>But this is another story I have to tell ;-)<br><br>Wish all of you a happy new year!\n  </p>",

One of my goals was to install all my virtual machines with the Cloud-init solution. With Cloud-init it is possible to inject informations such as ssh keys, network information or user profiles in an standarized way at boot time. The benefit of using Cloud-init is the pre-provisioning of necessary configuration items such as a static ip address or a default user with activated ssh public key authentication. Furthermore, this kind of provisioning helps a lot for further automation steps with Ansible or even complete CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab, Jenkins etc. But first, let's start with the VM provisioning steps in Proxmox.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"location-of-cloud-init-images\">\n      Location of Cloud-Init images\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Nowadays, nearly all big Linux distributions offer ready to use Cloud-init images.

I took vmbr0 because it is the standard bridge in Proxmox. Feel free to use another one or add additional hardware to your template.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"import-the-disk-image-in-the-local-proxmox-storage\">\n      Import the disk image in the local Proxmox storage\n    </h3>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>bash\nqm importdisk 9000 ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img local-lvm\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The command line utility copies the image in the local Proxmox storage and assigns it to the previously created template VM with the id 9000. Because it is the first disk for the vm, Proxmox is creating a disk with the naming \"vm-9000-disk-0\".\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"configure-your-virtual-machine-to-use-the-disk-image\">\n      Configure your virtual machine to use the disk image\n    </h3>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>bash\nqm set 9000 --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --scsi0 local-lvm:vm-9000-disk-0\n</code></pre>\n\n    <h3 id=\"adding-the-cloud-init-image-as-cd-rom-to-your-virtual-machine\">\n      Adding the Cloud-init image as CD-Rom to your virtual machine\n    </h3>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-bash\"><code>qm set 9000 --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    This is an important step, because it allows you to change the settings I've already mentioned before.

We didn't set a user which means Ubuntu is using the default one (ubuntu). That's it! Your Cloud-Init image should now boot up fine with the desired settings.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"next-steps\">\n      Next steps\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    This tutorial is just the beginning.

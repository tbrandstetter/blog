      A few words about Terraform
    </h2>

  <p>
    If you have read my <a href="https://norocketscience.at/about/">last blog post</a> you already know how to create templates for further provisioning using the Cloud-init specification. In this post I like to show you how you easily deploy your infrastructure using Terraform on the virtualisation solution Proxmox. First of all, what is Terraform exactly? Terraform is a so called "Infrastructure as a code" software developed by <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com">Hashicorp</a> - a company which also created <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and other famous tools for professional cloud solutions. According to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code">Microsoft</a>,<br>
  </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.<br>
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    What's the benefit you may ask. One of the biggest advantages is that you don't have to install your servers and other components manually. Instead, with just a few lines of code you're able to manage your complete infrastructure. This automation step brings your stability, quality improvements, resilience and time for more important things. Furthermore, you have the possibility to integrate your Terraform configuration into your existing VCS and automatically run changes through your infrastructure with a proper CI/CD pipeline.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Another good question - why use Terraform if you've already have Ansible in place?Have you ever tried to remove a package in Ansible? If you just remove it from you playbook configuration it is still on your server until you write the right configuration (the attribute "absent" is your friend) or remove it manualy. Terraform takes care on this changes and has a clever dependency management for "First this, then that" decisions. Writing about the differences between the two would hijack my "Terraform practicing" article, so to keep a long story short:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use Terraform for all your infrastructure stuff (VMs and the baseline software on it)</li><li>Use Ansible for the configuration management (Installation of Applications and the configuration of it)</li>
  </ul>

      Let's start practicing
    </h2>

    <h3 id="assumptions">
      Assumptions
    </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>You have already a Proxmox server installed (it works with other virtualisation and cloud providers too - but this article is about Proxmox and Terraform)</li><li>You have already OS-templates with Cloud-init defined (if not, please read my <a href="https://norocketscience.at/about/">blog post</a> about it)</li>
  </ul>

    <h3 id="installation-of-terraform">
      Installation of Terraform
    </h3>

  <p>
    You can install Terraform on the major plattforms using either the package manager/appstore from the chosen system or download the binaries from <br><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install">Hashicorp</a> directly. On OSX I used <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for OSX.
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash
brew install terraform</code></pre>

    <h3 id="configure-your-first-terraform-project">
      Configure your first Terraform project
    </h3>

  <p>
    Now we're going to configure our first Terraform infrastructure which runs on Proxmox. In my example, I like to install a small Kubernetes infrastructure which should run <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution)</a> later on. For that <br>we have to define the following environment:<br>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 x Master Server</li><li>2 x Node Server</li><li>1 x Storage Server (for persistent storage)</li>
  </ul>

    <h4 id="configure-the-proxmox-provider">
      Configure the Proxmox provider
    </h4>

  <p>
    First, we configure the connection settings for the Proxmox provider. I chose the provider from <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox">Telmate</a> for the Proxmox provisioning. For better readability of our infrastructure code, we split variables and provider in two different configuration files named <em></em><strong><em>variables.tf</em> </strong>and <strong><em>provider.tf</em></strong>
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-json"><code># variables.tf

variable "pm_api_url" {
  default = "https://your-ip:8006/api2/json"
}

variable "pm_user" {
  default = "terraform-prov@pve"
}

variable "pm_password" {
  default = "your-password"
}
</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-json"><code># provider.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source  = "telmate/proxmox"
      version = "3.0.2-rc07"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  pm_parallel     = 1
  pm_tls_insecure = true
  pm_api_url      = var.pm_api_url
  pm_password     = var.pm_password
  pm_user         = var.pm_user
  pm_log_enable   = true
  pm_log_file     = "terraform-plugin-proxmox.log"
  pm_debug        = true
  pm_log_levels = {
    _default    = "debug"
    _capturelog = ""
  }
}
</code></pre>

    <h4 id="configure-the-virtual-machines">
      Configure the virtual machines
    </h4>

  <p>
    Next step is the main configuration of our k3s-cluster server. Here you have to adapt the following attributes according to your configuration:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>target_node (the name of your Proxmox instance)</li><li>name (the name of the virtual server)</li><li>clone (the name of the template in Proxmox)</li><li>cores</li><li>memory</li><li>storage (the right storage pool in Proxmox)</li><li>ipconfig0 (Use the right IP range for your servers - the count.index is necessary if you have more then one server configured - like the k3s_agents in the example below)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The "ignore changes" lifecycle block is necessary, because Terraform likes to change the mac address on the second run - maybe a problem in the Proxmox provider - see here: <a href="https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112">https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112</a>

  <p>
    Terraform has a simple but powerful deployment cycle, which consists of the following steps:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Init - Initializes the Terraform project and install needed plugins, dependencies...</li><li>Validate - Validates the syntax of the created Terraform .tf files</li><li>Plan - Calculates the steps and changes to install/upgrade your infrastructure</li><li>Apply - Applies the changes on the configured systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you try to skip a step for example start with terraform plan, Terraform inform you to initialise the project first:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>Error: Could not satisfy plugin requirements


Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".

Plugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate
resources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,
don't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.

Terraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your
configuration, including providers used in child modules. To see the
requirements and constraints from each module, run "terraform providers".



Error: provider.proxmox: new or changed plugin executable</code></pre>

  <p>
    So let's start with the initialisation first:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.</code></pre>

  <p>
    And Terraform informs you about the next step. But instead we like to check if our configuration ist correct:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>terraform validate

Success! The configuration is valid.</code></pre>

  <p>
    Seems we did a good job during our configuration. Now it's the time to see what Terraform likes to deploy:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>terraform plan

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

.
.
.
.

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: planfile

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "planfile"
</code></pre>

  <p>
    As you can see - Terraform likes to install 4 new server. It also shows us the detailed configuration. The configuration can be read like a "diff" file:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>"+" means add</li><li>"-" means remove</li><li>"~" means replaced</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The file "planfile" can be used for the next apply command:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>terraform apply planfile

Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: terraform.tfstate</code></pre>

  <p>
    Depending on your hardware this needs some time. If everything runs fine you can see the output above. Terraform successfully created 4 new ressources, which you can use for install the K3s cluster. Because we don't like to install anything manually we will use Ansible for this job. <br><br>But this is another story I have to tell ;-)<br><br>Wish all of you a happy new year!

  <p>
    Due to performance problems with my ESXI homelab I decided to give the open source solution Proxmox a try. One of my goals was to install all my virtual machines with the Cloud-init solution. With Cloud-init it is possible to inject informations such as ssh keys, network information or user profiles in an standarized way at boot time. The benefit of using Cloud-init is the pre-provisioning of necessary configuration items such as a static ip address or a default user with activated ssh public key authentication. Furthermore, this kind of provisioning helps a lot for further automation steps with Ansible or even complete CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab, Jenkins etc. But first, let's start with the VM provisioning steps in Proxmox.
  </p>

    <h2 id="location-of-cloud-init-images">

  <p>
    Nowadays, nearly all big Linux distributions offer ready to use Cloud-init images. Here is a short list of mirrors where you can choose the distribution that fits your needs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ubuntu: <a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com">https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com</a></li><li>Debian: <a href="https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/">https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/</a></li><li>CentOs: <a href="https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/">https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/</a></li>
  </ul>

    <h2 id="create-your-template">
      Create your template
    </h2>

  <p>
    All commands below have to be executed on the Proxmox server. You can ssh into it or use the shell in the web interface.
  </p>

    <h3 id="download-the-image-on-your-proxmox-server">
      Download the image on your Proxmox server
    </h3>

  <p>
    I'm using Ubuntu for my VMs
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash 
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/daily/server/releases/24.04/release/ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
</code></pre>

    <h3 id="define-your-virtual-machine-as-templatelessbrgreater">
      Define your virtual machine as template<br>
    </h3>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash
qm create 9000 --name "ubuntu-2404-cloudinit-template" --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0
</code></pre>

  <p>
    With this command you have created a new virtual machine with the id 9000 (has to be unique in the Proxmox ecosystem), 2 gigabyte of ram and a bridge network using the virtio controller. I took vmbr0 because it is the standard bridge in Proxmox. Feel free to use another one or add additional hardware to your template.
  </p>

    <h3 id="import-the-disk-image-in-the-local-proxmox-storage">
      Import the disk image in the local Proxmox storage
    </h3>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash
qm importdisk 9000 ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img local-lvm
</code></pre>

  <p>
    The command line utility copies the image in the local Proxmox storage and assigns it to the previously created template VM with the id 9000. Because it is the first disk for the vm, Proxmox is creating a disk with the naming "vm-9000-disk-0".
  </p>

    <h3 id="configure-your-virtual-machine-to-use-the-disk-image">
      Configure your virtual machine to use the disk image

  <p>
    This is an important step, because it allows you to change the settings I've already mentioned before. Do not set anything else here, because we're using this virtual machine as a template. You can edit the settings after you've cloned the template for use.<br>

    </h2>

  <p>
    With the template you can clone as many virtual machines as you like and change the Cloud-init parameters for your needs. First we have to clone the template to a new virtual machine:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash
qm clone 9000 100 --name my-virtual-machine</code></pre>

  <p>
    We created a new virtual machine with the unique id 100 and the name "my-virtual-machine". Now you can change the Cloud-init settings either in the admin ui or with the qm command:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-bash"><code>bash
qm set 100 --sshkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
qm set 123 --ipconfig0 ip=192.168.2.100/24,gw=192.168.2.1</code></pre>

  <p>
    With this command you have set a public key for SSH authentication and the static IP 192.168.2.100. We didn't set a user which means Ubuntu is using the default one (ubuntu). That's it! Your Cloud-Init image should now boot up fine with the desired settings.

    This tutorial is just the beginning. You're now able to use Terraform, Ansible or other automation tools to create "Infrastructure as a code" helping you to ramp up whole datacenters with just a few commands.

    But this is another story I have to tell ;-)
